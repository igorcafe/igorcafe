#+title: Cosine Similarity

\begin{equation}
\text{Cosine Similarity} =
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i B_i}
{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} B_i^2}}
\end{equation}

Cosine similarity is a technique that can be used to compare [[id:32FB6AAE-BC5F-4E7D-8340-8C51FB8C4BAE][text similarity]].
It works better if you are using [[id:98A4A9DA-8E94-4CC0-BE45-1BE50E1180DB][Text Embeddings]], as if you just compare
words, "He eat" and "She drinks" will have no similarity, although they share
similar semantics.

Given the phrases:
1. "love you"
2. "you love"
3. "love love"
4. "you"

We can represent them as:
| love | you | angle |
|------+-----+-------|
|    1 |   1 |    45 |
|    1 |   1 |    45 |
|    2 |   0 |     0 |
|    0 |   1 |    90 |

If we compare first and second phrases, the angle between them is 0, and cos 0
is 1, so the cosine similarity is 1.

If we compare first and third phrases, the angle between them is 45, and cos 45
is 0.71.

If we compare second and forth phrases, the angle between them is also 45, so
0.71.

If we compare third and forth, their angle is 90, and cos 90 is 0.
Make sense since there is no similar word between the phrases.
